# GoMusic
BB10 Google Music application

I created this for the BB10 App Store which is still available today.

This was closed source and I had always planned on keeping it that way (as you can tell, I used the commit messages as my own personal ranting space) but I have been approached by several existing users to open source the application and with the app making about $20 every 6 months and the code could be helpful, I figured why not.

It's my favorite personal project I have done over the years as I had to learn and solve many problems I haven't encountered during my
professional career such as solving caching and reading a media files at the same time they are being downloaded, reverse engineering the API which most credit goes to https://github.com/simon-weber but I had to translate all of that to C++/Qt/BB10 SDK code.

Please excuse any explicitives in my code as I was just having fun and enjoying what I do, writing software and solving diffcult but enjoyable problems!

I am releasing this under the license where I would like to attributed for any work borrowed from this project in its whole or parts.
